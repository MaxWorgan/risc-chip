## Production With TidalCycles

_RISC Chip_ was composed, produced, and performed using the [TidalCycles](http://tidalcycles.org)
live-coding pattern environment. If you wish to use this source code, you must install
TidalCycles first.

## Audio Samples

Audio samples are in the [samples](tree/master/samples) folder. They are structured in a way
that is compatible with the TidalCycles environment. **Note**: samples were used only for the
tracks [RISC Chip](https://github.com/kindohm/risc-chip/blob/master/tracks/04.RISC-Chip.tidal), 
[Bit Dust](https://github.com/kindohm/risc-chip/blob/master/tracks/05.Bit-Dust.tidal), and
[Viewport](https://github.com/kindohm/risc-chip/blob/master/tracks/06.Viewport.tidal)
(all other tracks used live synthesizers with MIDI).
