## Audio Samples

Audio samples are in the [samples](tree/master/samples) folder. They are structured in a way
that is compatible with the TidalCycles environment. **Note**: samples were used only for the
tracks [RISC Chip](blob/master/tracks/01.32-bit-Falcon.tidal) and 
[Bit Dust](blob/master/tracks/01.32-bit-Falcon.tidal).
