-- there is so much improvation in this track that there isn't much 
-- point in showing the code, but it's basically something like this:

c1 $ foldEvery [2,3] (|+| begin "0.1") $ 
sound "ringsurfing([3 5 7]/3,8)" |=| cut "1"
|=| begin "{0.2 0.2 0.3}%4"

-- and continuously changing the values of "begin", and making
-- other Tidal tweaks.

-- also, the sample for this track is not included in the GitHub
-- repository. It is a 4-minute wav file that is too big.
